# DEBATE — "THBT If Women Ruled the World, It Would Be a Much Better Place"

## Position : GOUVERNEMENT (Proposition / Pour)

## ARGUMENT UNIQUE (2-5 min) — Pret a livrer

Madam Speaker, Members of the House,

Let me start with a number. Nine out of ten. That is the proportion of peace negotiation tables around the world that include zero women. Not a minority of women. Not an underrepresentation. Zero.

And here is what that costs us. The United Nations' own research shows that when women participate directly in peace negotiations, the probability that an agreement lasts at least two years increases by twenty percent. And the probability that it lasts fifteen years — a generation of peace — increases by thirty-five percent. Meanwhile, more than half of all peace agreements today collapse within five years. So we are failing at peace, and we are simultaneously excluding the very people who, according to the data, make peace last.

This is not ideology. This is evidence. And it extends far beyond the negotiation table.

The Georgetown Women, Peace and Security Index — published just last year — ranks one hundred and eighty-one countries on women's inclusion, justice, and security. The top five countries are Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, and Luxembourg. These are not just the best countries for women. They are among the most peaceful, most prosperous, most democratic nations on Earth. The countries at the bottom of that index — where women are most excluded from power — are the most violent, the most unstable, the most fragile. This pattern repeats, year after year, across every dataset. The Council on Foreign Relations confirms it: higher female parliamentary representation is directly associated with a decreased risk of civil war.

Now, some might say: "That is correlation, not causation." Fair point. So let us look at causation.

McKinsey and Company found that companies with gender diversity at the top are twenty-one percent more likely to achieve above-average profitability. Harvard Business Review found that moving from zero to thirty percent women in leadership increases net profit margins by fifteen percent. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a study by the University of Reading showed that countries led by women produced — and I quote — "systematically and significantly better outcomes." Why? Because women leaders prioritised lives over short-term economic numbers. They locked down earlier. They acted faster. And in the long run, that turned out to be the smarter economic strategy too.

But we do not even need to look at studies. We can look at leaders.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf — first woman elected head of state in Africa. She inherited Liberia after a devastating civil war. She secured the cancellation of nearly four hundred million dollars of debt. She led her country through the Ebola crisis. She won the Nobel Peace Prize. Jacinda Ardern guided New Zealand through a terrorist attack, a volcanic eruption, and a pandemic — with empathy, transparency, and decisiveness. Her party won its biggest electoral victory in fifty years. Angela Merkel governed Europe's largest economy for sixteen years through three major crises. Stability. Competence. Results.

These women did not succeed by imitating men. They led differently. And the results speak for themselves.

So, Madam Speaker, when the opposition tells you that this motion is naive, or utopian, or essentialist — remind them of this. We are not claiming that women are inherently superior. We are saying that the world has run an experiment for centuries — almost exclusively male leadership — and the results are in. Wars are at a historic peak. Half of peace agreements fail. Trust in institutions is collapsing.

Maybe — just maybe — it is time to try the other half of humanity.

I support this motion.
